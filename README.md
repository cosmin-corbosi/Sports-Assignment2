## Assignment/Project Number 2

## Brief description of Assignment/Project

Used python and matplotlib to create a tennis court and save it as a PNG. Did this using a notebook, as I think it was pretty straightforward, and did not warrant the use of a module.

Also getting the hang of using git!

I haven't deleted any of the old files after forking the repository.

## Setup

If using `pyenv` virtual env:

```shell
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Otherwise activate your conda environment.

From your virtual environment:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Extra Comments

Curious to know if we'll always have to plot the playing fields ourselves, or if there's a way to import them using an image? ~for stuff that's harder to plot, such as basketball court lines.

Going forward, should I delete the parts of the forked skeletons that I don't modify/use?

I also added comments direcly in the new notebook I created "tennis_court". There I just wrote a few questions alongside the code (also for myself in the future). It's just me looking for ways to be efficient and best practices; stuff I couldn't easily find on google.
